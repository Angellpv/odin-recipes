            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
                     A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
                      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
